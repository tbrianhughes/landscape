# Southern Wax Myrtle #

Scientific Name: Myrica cerifera

Alternate Names:

- Bayberry

## Description ##

Wax myrtle is an evergreen tree that may grow 20 to 25 feet tall, but usually is much shorter. Width gets to be 8 to 10 feet wide. The light olive green leaves emit a spicy aromatic odor when crushed. The bark is thin, smooth, and gray-brown, almost white. In spring, small male and female slim, cylindrical flowers mature. Females produces a bluish-white drupe that matures in clusters on short stalks and lasts through the winter. Both males and females are required for flowering and berry production.

It fixes atmospheric nitrogen which helps it survive in poor soils.

Can grow without pruning, planted and shaped as a hedge, or as a small tree with lower limbs removed.

Interesting plant for grouping in the corner of a large herb garden.

The fruits of this species have been used for many years to make bayberry candles, soaps, and sealing wax.

Provides excellent winter and extreme weather cover. Flowers provide an excellent source of nectar for honeybes and butterflies. The fruits are eaten by birds, expecially yellow-rumped warbler in the fall and winter.

Good buffer and screening plant. Fragrant, wildlife food source, wildlife larval host.

Highly resistant to deer damage.
