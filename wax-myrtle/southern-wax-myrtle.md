# Southern Wax Myrtle #

Scientific Name: Myrica cerifera

Alternate Names:

- Southern Bayberry

## Description ##

Wax myrtle is an evergreen tree that may grow 20 to 25 feet tall, but usually is much shorter. Width gets to be 8 to 10 feet wide. The light olive green leaves emit a spicy aromatic odor when crushed. The bark is thin, smooth, and gray-brown, almost white. In spring, small male and female slim, cylindrical flowers mature. Females produces a bluish-white drupe that matures in clusters on short stalks and lasts through the winter. Both males and females are required for flowering and berry production.

It fixes atmospheric nitrogen which helps it survive in poor soils.

Can grow without pruning, planted and shaped as a hedge, or as a small tree with lower limbs removed.
